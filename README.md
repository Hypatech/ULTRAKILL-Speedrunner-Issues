# ULTRAKILL Speedrunner Issue Tracker
To keep track of gameplay changes which would make speedrunning more fun.

# Guidelines
- Make seperate issues for each change you want to see, so that they can be tracked and discussed seperately.
- Title your issues in a (relatively) sane way.
- Please include as much information as possible about the change, as it'll be more likely to be implemented that way. Videos and pictures welcome.
